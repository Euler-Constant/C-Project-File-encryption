# C-Project-File-encryption

*WHAT EVEN IS THIS C-PROJECT?*

Well, as an answer, the [C-Project] series is one I implemented to help me get much better at C through actual code implementation and projects, the first of which is the [File Encryption Tool]. It has the following functionality:

- File I/O: Reads from the source file and writes to a destination file.
- Key Processing: Convert the user’s key into a repeatable sequence.
- Encryption/Decryption Logic: Apply XOR to each byte. (Still figuring out the works here)
- Command-Line Interface: Accept user inputs (file paths, key, mode).

*How to use?*
- Command: ./tool encrypt secret.txt secret.enc "mykey"
- Process: Opens secret.txt, XORs each byte with mykey, writes to secret.enc.
- Reverse: ./tool decrypt secret.enc secret.dec.txt "mykey" restores the original.

It was a great exercise for knowledge on writing modular code, (and modular cleaning, this code was a mess at first) along with file handling and bitwise operations in C (Of which I am still learning).  Also added a little progress check to the code, given that this does not run as a GUI operation and as a CLI operation, there had to be some way to measure the progress of it all.
